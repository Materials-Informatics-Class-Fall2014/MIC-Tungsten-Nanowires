# Image Subtraction

<br><br>

Step 1: We a grayscale image to work on (Call it A)
<br>

<br><br>
Step 2: We use [IMADJUST](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imadjust.html) on the image (Call it B)
<br>

<br><br>
Step 3: We use [IMCOMPLEMENT](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imcomplement.html) on image A (Call it C)
<br>

<br><br>
Step 4: We use [IMADJUST](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imadjust.html) on the image B (Call it D)
<br>

<br><br>
Step 5: We use subtract image D from Image B (Call it E)
<br>

<br><br>
Step 6:  We use [IMCOMPLEMENT](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imcomplement.html) on image E (Call it F)
<br>

Notes: 

  *  You can play with thresholding values to decrease or increase mid-range pixel values
  *  You can use [IMDILATE](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imdilate.html) or [IMERODE](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imerode.html)
  to thicken or thin lines
  *  You can use in tandem with Canny Edge Detection software to pick up some of the edges that the Canny Edge Detection missed.
  *  Seems to work really well with [image derivatives](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imgradient.html)
