# Image Subtraction

<br><br>

Step 1: We find the grayscale image we want to work on (Call it A)

<br><br>
Step 2: We use [IMADJUST](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imadjust.html) on the image (Call it B)

<br><br>
Step 3: We use [IMCOMPLEMENT](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imcomplement.html) on image A (Call it C)

<br><br>
Step 4: We use [IMADJUST](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imadjust.html) on the image B (Call it D)

<br><br>
Step 5: We use subtract image D from Image C (Call it E)

<br><br>
Step 6:  We use [IMCOMPLEMENT](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imcomplement.html) on image E (Call it F)

Notes:  
  - You can play with thresholding values to decrease or increase mid-range pixel values
  - You can use [IMDILATE](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imdilate.html) or [IMERODE](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imerode.html)
  to thicken or thin lines
  - You can use in tandem with Canny Edge Detection software to pick up some of the edges that the Canny Edge Detection missed.
  - Seems to work really well with [image derivatives](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imgradient.html)
