# Initial Attempts at Data Segmentation

For this trail run at segmentation, I varied the number of peaks between 3 and 8 and varied the number of bins from 10 to 1000. 
This provided extremely tedious.  For this post, I settled for an image capture with the following values:

*{{site.data['segmentation']}}*
