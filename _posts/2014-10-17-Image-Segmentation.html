# Initial Attempts at Data Segmentation

For this trail run at segmentation, I varied the number of peaks between 3 and 8 and varied the number of bins from 10 to 1000. 
This provided extremely tedious.  For this post, I settled for an image capture with the following values:

__{{site.data['segmentation']}}__

This is my outcome:

The image has been cropped to focus on a region of interest; that which we suspect is the evolvoing tri-oxide hydrate layer. 
For comparison sake, here is the orinal image deliniating the area of interest.
