# Initial Attempts at Data Segmentation

For this trail run at segmentation, I used the matlab code developed by [Dr. Tom O'Haver ](http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/) for 
peak fitting and the naive segmentation code written by [Tony.](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast/de3d7b841cea38dc40fa) I varied 
the number of peaks between 3 and 8 and varied the number of bins from 10 to 1000.  This provided extremely tedious.  
For this post, I settled for an image capture with the following values:

__{{site.data['segmentation']}}__

This is my outcome:

The image has been cropped to focus on a region of interest; that which we suspect is the evolvoing tri-oxide hydrate layer. 
For comparison sake, here is the orinal image deliniating the area of interest.

As you can see, the peak finding and fitting have some not so nice errors associated with conditions input.

## How does this relate to what has been done?

So, in reference to the segmented image, this image below represents the origianl image overlayed with the first spatial
derivative [work we did a couple of weeks prior.](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/09/26/Interface-Analysis.html)

I believe it is interesting to note that there whether we are taking numerical derivatives over the data or segmenting the data,
we find a simialar trend in this tri-oxide hydrate layer.
