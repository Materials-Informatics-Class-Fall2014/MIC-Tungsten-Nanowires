#  Smoothing Image Data Through Time

Images have been smoothed over time using an averaging weighting function:

$$A_{i}(smooth) = \frac{(0.5(A_{i+1})+A_{i}+0.5(A_{i-1}))}{2}$$

## Using MATLAB's mat2gray Function

On a hunch, the smoothed images were run through MATLAB's mat2gray function.  This helped increase contrast (imadjust was
tried, but the contrast washed out some features):
