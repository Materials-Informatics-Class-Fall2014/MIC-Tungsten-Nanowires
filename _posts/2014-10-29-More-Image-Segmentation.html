# Segmentation of Images

Initial attempts at image segmentation was unwieldy.  [One image](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/10/17/Image-Segmentation.html)
in particular turned out very good, but others not so much.  Below is the out put of the segmentation algorithm for the image
taken at 78 seconds compared to the original image.

## Refining the Segmentation Inputs

To eleminate some of the noise from the segmentation analysis, we had to reduce the amount of image that went was input
into the segmentation algorithm.  We used our [time derivative analysis](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/10/14/Time-Evolution.html)
to aid in this decision.  We also have an abberation in our images that affects our segmentation analysis as well.  Using 
both of these pieces of information, we decided on running our segmentation analys on rows 200 - 700 and columns 400 - 700 on 
each of the images.
