# Segmentation of Images

Initial attempts at image segmentation was unwieldy.  [One image](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/10/17/Image-Segmentation.html)
in particular turned out very good, but others not so much.  Below is the out put of the segmentation algorithm for the image
taken at 78 seconds (or 50% completion) compared to the original image.


Results of the Segmentation Algorithm for the Image at 50% Completion:

## Refining the Segmentation Inputs

To eleminate some of the noise from the segmentation analysis, we had to reduce the amount of image that went was input
into the segmentation algorithm.  We used our [time derivative analysis](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/10/14/Time-Evolution.html)
to aid in this decision.  We also have an abberation in our images that affects our segmentation analysis as well.  Using 
the time derivative analysis, we decided on running our segmentation analysis on columns 400 - 700 of each of the images.  To 
reduce the noise in data due to the abberation, we decided on further limiting each image to rows 200 - 500.

Using this, we conducted segmentation analysis on 3 samples: 

-  0% completion
-  50% completion
-  100%completion

Our input parameters in terms of the number of peaks and number of bins for the segmentation algorithm are as follows:
