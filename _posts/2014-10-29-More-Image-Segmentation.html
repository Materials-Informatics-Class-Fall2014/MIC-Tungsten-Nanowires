# Segmentation of Images

Initial attempts at image segmentation was unwieldy.  [One image](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/10/17/Image-Segmentation.html)
in particular turned out very good, but others not so much.  Below is the out put of the segmentation algorithm for the image
taken at 78 seconds compared to the original image:
