# Surface Analysis

Initial processing of images was conducted using [Image J](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).  All images are in [grayscale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale)
which aids in the ease of image processing (unlike the [CMYK color model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model) which 
uses more data layers and thus includes more information that must be processed). [Line plots](http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/line_plot.html)
were created to measure the inverted gray scale of all pixels across the width of the image.  As the [2-D tomography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_tomography)
data is a measure of the intensities of detected electrons through the material, it is our hope that the line plots may give us 
information about the transition zones around the surface of the tungsten wire sample.  Below is the initial line diagrams
(rough and unprocessed) for the sample at 0%, 50% and 100% through the tungsten-trioxide-hydrate growth process.

## Stepping up the level of analysis 

A [Matlab code](https://gist.github.com/jallen30gt/8254e9ea2f938363dc0b) was developed to begin the initial processing of images.
The code was written with three simple objectives in mind:

1.  [Smooth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing) noise in images (done with a simple adjacent point averaging at 10 and 500 times application).
2.  Find the [First Derivative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives) (numerical using centered finite-divided-difference formulas)
3.  Find the [Second Derivative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives) (numerical using centered finite-divided-difference formulas)

##What did we learn?

From this, we found that 10 applications of the simple smoothing algorithm did a sufficient job of smoothing the function. 
However, the first and second derivative data are much more sensitive and need higher applications of smoothing.  500 applications
did a very nice job, however, too much smoothing tends to eliminate adjacent peaks and tends to move slopes from the raw data
towards the same value.  We have also identified that in this point in time, we may not have much use for the second derivative; 
this could be evaluated later if we find  

##What we did next
A second [Matlab code](https://github.com/jallen30gt/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/blob/gh-pages/StartProj.m) was created to identify 
the interfaces in 2-D tomography images. This program advances some of the mathematical techniques used from our first program
and was written in collaboration with Tony Fast. Several features are different as will be discussed next.

## Workflow

*  [Matlab's 2-D median filtering](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/medfilt2.html) applied to smooth data
*  [Derivative7](http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~pk/Research/MatlabFns/Spatial/derivative7.m) function was used to find the first derivatives
*  [Matlab's imdilate function](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imdilate.html) was used to [dialte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology))(i.e., find local maximum values) images
*  Peaks were identified through dilation of the images and the peaks mapped to and identified on the original images 

<br>

## Interface Overlaps
The outcome of the second round of and more advanced image processing are shown below:

##What is our biggest problem?
*  Collaboration (or the lack thereof)
    -  Lack of working together
    -  Lack of coordinating efforts
*  Better understand where we are in our process ([previous benchmarks](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/project/identification/2014/09/15/Materials-Description.html) too ambitious?)
*  We need to see if we need to extend the number of local maximas from the first derivative to really capture the interfaces


##What can we do now?
* Fix our collaboration issues
  -  Working on communication
  -  We have had a meeting to task out workflow
  

Jason<br>

*  Maintaining Website and blog
*  Work on cleaning up Tony's program for our use (currently not working correctly)
*  Continue working with Tony's matlab script to further process all images
*  Play with different filters, derivative, dilations, etc.
*  Investigate areas under first derivative curves

David<br>

*  Evaluate image evolution (pixel changes) through time
*  Evaluate first derivative (peaks) evolution through
*  Investigate areas under first derivative curves
*  Possibly extend the number of local maxima from 1 to possibly capture multiple interfaces


##What can we do within two weeks?
*  Complete initial and advanced image processing
*  Hopefully identify microstructure features
