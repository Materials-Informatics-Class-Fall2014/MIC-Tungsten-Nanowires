# Surface Analysis

Initial processing of images was conducted using [Image J](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).  All images are in [grayscale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale)
which aids in the ease of image processing (unlike the [CMYK color model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model) which 
uses more data layers and thus includes more information that must be processed). [Line plots](http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/line_plot.html)
were created to measure the inverted gray scale of all pixels across the width of the image.  As the [2-D tomography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_tomography)
data is a measure of the intensities of detected electrons through the material, it is our hope that the line plots may give us 
information about the transition zones around the surface of the tungsten wire sample.  Below is the initial line diagrams
(rough and unprocessed) for the sample at 0%, 50% and 100% through the tungsten-trioxide-hydrate growth process.

A [Matlab code](https://github.com/jallen30gt/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/blob/gh-pages/StartProj.m) was created to indentify the interfaces
in CT images to indentify the surfaces.

## Workflow

* Filter
* Peak Find
