# Naive Segmentation

Multiple attempts ([1](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/10/17/Image-Segmentation.html), [2](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/10/31/More-Image-Segmentation.html))
have been made at using the [naive segmentation (or Gaussian maximum likelihood)](http://materials-informatics-lab.github.io/2014/10/14/Image-Segmentation.html)
algorithms to segment our images.  This process is slow, tedious and quite frankly frustrating.  Many hours have been spent
in attempts to segment 3 images (0%, 50% and 100% completion) and we would like to segment all images expediently (at least more so
than previous attempts).

To combat this issues, we attempt a simple segmentation.  Essentially, we are dividing the max and min values in to bracketed 
ranges as follows (Note:  because we have used mat2gray function in MATLAB, our values range from 0 -1):

-  values < .1 = 0
-  values > .1 & values < .3 = .2
-  values > .3 & values < .5 = .4
-  values > .5 & values < .7 = .6
-  values > .7 & values < .9 = .8
-  values > .9 = 1

While we understand that the Gaussian maximum likelihood algorith offers the user more options and control in fitting data,
time is of the essence and we need a quicker way to subjectively view the behavior of our data over time.  Below are the smoothed
images and segmented images for 0%, 50%, and 100% completion:
