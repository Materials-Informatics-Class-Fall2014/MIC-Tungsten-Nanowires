## Meeting

Today David Zhao and myself met with Dr. Tony Fast and Maryana Nave (a Ph.D. student and researcher at Clemson University) 
a project out of Clemson University. [This](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast/e88e9bba7dcd5e173fb2) project was posted by Dr. 
Kalidindi on August 30th for anyone who did not have a project and wanted to volunteer.
