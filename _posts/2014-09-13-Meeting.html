## Meeting

Today, David Zhao and myself met with Dr. Tony Fast and Maryana Nave (a Ph.D. student and researcher at Clemson University) 
regarding a project out of Clemson University. [This](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast/e88e9bba7dcd5e173fb2) project was posted by Dr. 
Kalidindi on August 30th for anyone who did not have a project and wanted to volunteer.  Through our discussion, we found that
our original concept of this proposed project (process-structure evolution linkages in the surface layer porosity of the tungsten shell during 
electropolishing) may be infeasible for the data we have been provided.

## Where to go from here

Throughout our meeting, David, Dr. Fast and myself gained a better understanding of the [original research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23924892).
