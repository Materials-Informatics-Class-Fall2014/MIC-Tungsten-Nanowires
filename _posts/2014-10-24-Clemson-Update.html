## Initial Surface Analysis

Initial processing of images was conducted using [Image J](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), an image software package developed at
the National Institute of Health.  All images have 1024 rows of pixels and 1024 columns of pixels with each pixel representing
an area of approximately 38.9 nm by 38.9 nm.  [Line plots](http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/line_plot.html)
were created to measure the inverted gray scale signal intensities of all pixels across the entire width (all pixel columns) 
of the image and averaged across pixel 
rows 330 - 370.  As the [2-D tomography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_tomography) data is a measure of the intensities of detected electrons 
through the material, it is exptected that the line plots will yield information regarding the transition zones around the 
surface of the tungsten wire sample and the evolvig tungsten-trioxide-hydrate layer.  Below is the initial line diagrams 
(using the raw data) for the sample at 0%, 50% and 100% completion through the tungsten-trioxide-hydrate growth process.

<br>

As can be seen from the line plots, the data is quite noisey (and significantly so towards the edge of the images).  This is 
important as this noise becomes relevant and needs to be reduced with regards to further image processing.  


## Refining the Level of Analysis 

A [Matlab code](https://gist.github.com/jallen30gt/8254e9ea2f938363dc0b) was developed to refine the initial processing of 
images. The code was written with three simple objectives in mind:

1.  [Smooth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing) the noise in images (done with a simple [adjacent point averaging](http://www.originlab.com/doc/Origin-Help/Smooth-Algorithm) at 10 and 500 times application).
2.  Find the [First Derivative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives) (numerical using centered finite-divided-difference formulas)
3.  Find the [Second Derivative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives) (numerical using c formulas)

## What Information was Garnered?

Application of the simple smoothing algorithm 10 times did a sufficient job of smoothing the function.  However, the first and 
second derivative algorithms are much more sensitive and need higher applications of smoothing as can be seen in the level of
residual noise in the second first and second derivative plots.  Application of the simple smoothing algorithm 500 times
did a very nice job of smoothing the data, but eliminates all of the interesting features of the plots.  Over-smoothing 
tends to eliminate adjacent (split) peaks and tends to move slopes from the raw data towards the same value.   It was also 
found that at this point in time, the second derivative of the data may not yield any important information.  

##What we did next
A second [Matlab code](https://github.com/jallen30gt/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/blob/gh-pages/StartProj.m) was created to identify 
the interfaces in 2-D tomography images. This program advances some of the mathematical techniques used from our first program
and was written in collaboration with Tony Fast. Several features are different as will be discussed next.

## Workflow

*  [Matlab's 2-D median filtering](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/medfilt2.html) applied to smooth data
*  [Derivative7](http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~pk/Research/MatlabFns/Spatial/derivative7.m) function was used to find the first derivatives
*  [Matlab's imdilate function](http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imdilate.html) was used to [dialte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology))(i.e., find local maximum values) images
*  Peaks were identified through dilation of the images and the peaks mapped to and identified on the original images 

<br>

## Interface Overlaps
The outcome of the second round of and more advanced image processing are shown below:

# Time Evolution of Raw Data 

Second step of image processing is the evolve of layer overtime, we plot different region of the image against time 
and hopefully it can give us more information about the layer evolve and, like when it is actually occur and how it is 
evolved. The first thing we do is plug the average pixel value (from rows 500 to 600) of each column overtime, we have 
1024 columns so we got 1024 graphs, each graph has average pixel value as y and the time as x. We can see at the 
beginning of the graph there is no trend, which is as expected because the layer most likely to found in the middle 
region of the image. As we keep moving right to the image, we can see clearly a shape represent the image evolve. 
It actually looks exactly like exponential function, and then change to a logistic function. I cannot figure 
out a precise function yet to describe this process overtime, but I believe that will be a valid next step.
<br>
<br>

Evolution of <b>columns 1-10</b> with time are shown below:

Evolution of <b>columns 448-468</b> with time are shown below:

Evolution of <b>columns 555-580</b> with time are shown below:

# Time Derivative of Raw Data 

We also take the derivative of the data with time, but the resulting plot does not have obviously imformation as it is 
extremely noisy. We have to figure out a better filter and smoothing function to make that part useful, cause it can be 
useful as anvalid evidence for use to figure out the layer evolve function.

<br>


# Peak Position Time Evolution

Another interesting found is by ploting the location of peak (the place where change is the most dramatic). Over time, 
we can see the location have a almost linear down trend, but he maximum value(the change that happen between different 
column) has a linear trend of increase, we will discuss more about it and figure out what does that mean to us .

# Geometry of Derivatives?

By taking the derivative of the pictures, we can see at the beginning, the peak of the graph must represent layers, the 
peak region is almost like a rectangular. Then as time goes on, the peak region become more like a triangle, is that 
because there will only be one layer at the end?

# Initial Attempts at Data Segmentation

For this trail run at segmentation, I used the matlab code developed by [Dr. Tom O'Haver ](http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/) for 
peak fitting and the [naive segmentation](https://gist.github.com/tonyfast/de3d7b841cea38dc40fa) code written by Tony. I also 
used different matlab filters and smoothing functions to smooth the data (imfilter in tandom with fspecial, imresize, wiener2).
I varied the number of peaks between 3 and 8 and varied the number of bins from 10 to 1000. This provided extremely tedious. 
For this post, I settled for an image capture with the following values:

__{{site.data['segmentation']}}__

<br>
This image shows my initial efforts with the image truncated to the area of interest:

![Segmentation Image](http://i.imgur.com/MH8CuxO.jpg "Segmentation image ran with 7 peaks and 250 bins")

<br>


The image has been cropped to focus on a region of interest; that which we suspect is the evolvoing tri-oxide hydrate layer. 
For comparison sake, here is the orinal image deliniating the area of interest.

<br>

<br><br>

As you can see, the peak finding and fitting have some not so nice errors associated with conditions input.

<br>

## How does this relate to what has been done?

So, in reference to the segmented image, this image below represents the origianl image overlayed with the first spatial
derivative [work we did a couple of weeks prior.](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/09/26/Interface-Analysis.html)

<br>

<br>

I believe it is interesting to note that there whether we are taking numerical derivatives over the data or segmenting the data,
we find a simialar trend in this tri-oxide hydrate layer.
