# Time Evolution of Raw Data 

Second step of image processing is the evolve of layer overtime, we plot different region of the image against time 
and hopefully it can give us more information about the layer evolve and, like when it is actually occur and how it is 
evolved. The first thing we do is plug the average pixel value (from rows 500 to 600) of each column overtime, we have 
1024 columns so we got 1024 graphs, each graph has average pixel value as y and the time as x. We can see at the 
beginning of the graph there is no trend, which is as expected because the layer most likely to found in the middle 
region of the image. As we keep moving right to the image, we can see clearly a shape represent the image evolve. 
It actually looks exactly like exponential function, and then change to a logistic function. I cannot figure 
out a precise function yet to describe this process overtime, but I believe that will be a valid next step.

Evolution of columns 1-10 with time are shown below:

Evolution of columns 448-468 with time are shown below:

Evolution of columns 555-580 with time are shown below:

We also take the derivative of the data with time, but the resulting plot does not have obviously imformation, we 
have to figure out a better filter and smoothing function to make that part useful, cause it can be useful as an 
valid evidence for use to figure out the layer evolve function.


2, Another interesting found is by ploting the location of peak( the place where change is the most dramatic) overtime, 
we can see the location have a almost linear down trend, but he maximum value(the change that happen between different 
column) has a linear trend of increase, we will discuss more about it and figure out what does that mean to us .

By taking the derivative of the pictures, we can see at the beginning, the peak of the graph must represent layers, the 
peak region is almost like a rectangular. Then as time goes on, the peak region become more like a triangle, is that 
because there will only be one layer at the end? 


Please insert time 1-5 and time 150 to 155.


By complete that part of the analysis, I think we pretty much done with the image processing ,our next step would be
using the information we have to really figure out how is the layer evolved and how it is related to the derivative peak
