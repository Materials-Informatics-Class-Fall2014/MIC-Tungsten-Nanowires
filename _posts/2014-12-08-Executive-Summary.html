# Executive Summary

## Initial Project Goal

Our initial project goal consisted of characterizing the porosity distribution and evolution within a tungsten 
tri-oxide hydrate layer growing on a tungsten nano-wire surface.  This research stemmed from [Dr. Maryana Nave's](http://www.clemson.edu/ces/kornevlab/people.html)
(a PhD student at Clemson University) Ph.D. thesis and was conducted in conjunction with her research advisor, [Dr. Konstantin Kornev](http://www.clemson.edu/mse/People/bios/Kornev.htm).  
It became evident early on that we had insufficient data to visualize porosity and could not meet this goal.  [Initial data
analysis](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/09/26/Interface-Analysis.html) consisted of creating 
line plots across the images and conducting numerical differentiation on the data.  It was found that we might be able to 
use imaging analysis techniques to identify phase boundary layers growing and evolving on the tungsten surface.  After a 
conference call with Drs. Kalidindi, Fast, Nave and Kornev and David and myself and presenting our initial findings, we 
decided that we could modify our goal to provide some interesting data characterization that may yet prove usefull to the 
Clemson Research group.

## Modified Project Goal

Modified Project Goal: 

*  To characterize the growth and evolution of layers at tungsten/KOH interface using computational 
techniques.  

Objectives:

*  Identify the layers on the tungsten surface
*  Characterize each layer's velocity
*  Characterize each layer's curvatures
*  Attempt to run spatial statistics on each layer's velocity and curvature profile
