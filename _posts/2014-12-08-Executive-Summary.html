# Executive Summary

## Initial Project Goal

Our initial project goal consisted of characterizing the porosity distribution and evolution within a tungsten 
tri-oxide hydrate layer growing on a tungsten nano-wire surface.  This research stemmed from [Dr. Maryana Nave's](http://www.clemson.edu/ces/kornevlab/people.html)
(a PhD student at Clemson University) Ph.D. thesis and was conducted in conjunction with her research advisor, [Dr. Konstantin Kornev](http://www.clemson.edu/mse/People/bios/Kornev.htm).
It became evident early on that we had insufficient data to visualize porosity and could not meet this goal.  

[Initial data analysis](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/09/26/Interface-Analysis.html) consisted of creating 
line plots across the images and conducting numerical differentiation on the data.  It was found that we might be able to 
use imaging analysis techniques to identify phase boundary layers growing and evolving on the tungsten surface.  After a 
conference call with Drs. Kalidindi, Fast, Nave and Kornev and David and myself and presenting our initial findings, we 
decided that we could modify our goal to provide some interesting data characterization that may yet prove usefull to the 
Clemson Research group.

## Modified Project Goal

Modified Project Goal: 

*  To characterize the growth and evolution of layers at tungsten/KOH interface using computational 
techniques.  

Objectives:

*  Identify the layers on the tungsten surface
*  Characterize each layer's velocity
*  Characterize each layer's curvatures
*  Attempt to run spatial statistics on each layer's velocity and curvature profile
  

## Workflow

With the above objectives in mind, we employed a number of tactics to reach our objectives; it should be noted, however,
that at this time we have not completed all of our objectives.

Our tactics fall into two directions:

*  Numerically differentiate image data spatially
*  Numerically differentiate image data temporally

### Spatial Differentiation

Spatial differentiation was conducted employing the following methods:

*  Gaussian smoothing (convolution operator) – to reduce noise in the image data
*  Spatial numerical derivatives across images (image gradients) – to find where image data changes the most
*  Obtaining image gradient compliment image for [Image/Image Complement subtraction](http://jallen30gt.github.io/MIC-Tungsten-Nanowires/2014/11/23/Image-Subtraction.html)
*  Image/Image Complement subtraction - to pinpoint phase boundary layers

### Temporal Differentiation

Temporal differentiation was conducted employing the following methods:

*  Gaussian smoothing (convolution operator) – to reduce noise in the image data 
*  Numerical derivatives across pixels through time – highlights and broadens the changes in the image data
*  Contrasting the image intensities to highlight salient features for Canny Edge detection
*  Canny Edge detection – to pinpoint phase boundary layers

### Combining Each Technique

Both techniques when combined gave us really nice binary images that allowed us to characterize layers that we suspected
existed on the tungsten surface along with other layers that came as a surprise.  Using these binary images, we were able 
to characterize phase layer average velocities in very simple manner.

## Punch List for Further Work

Although the semester is over, this project will continue.  The punch list for the next few weeks includes:

*  Present at FLAMEL Workshop (12/10/2014)
*  Calculate Phase Boundary Curvatures
*  Run Spatial Statistics on Velocities and Curvatures
*  Present Findings to Clemson Researchers


## Problems/Hurdles

*  Time management - We sometimes had problems synching our schedules to meet
*  Collaboration (or the lack thereof) became an issue several times
*  Data analysis roadblocks - In many cases, incremental progress would be made and we would hit another wall
*  Data analysis dead-ends - In some cases, we reached a dead-end in our method and had to take several steps back or a whole new approach


##  What We Learned

*  Data science provides very efficient ways to manage large amounts of data...even when you think it doesn't apply to your problem
   -  In our case, I thought spatial statistics could not be used.  I am eager to see what spatial statistics can tell us about our velocites and curvatures
*  Collaboration is hard....but it doesn't have to be
   -  The internet provides a rapid yet flexible means of collaborating.  Many tools have been created that allow for online collaboration 
*  Many times in research, there is no answer...but if you work hard enough, you might stumble across one
   -  Even when there are answers, in some cases you will have to teach yourself how to reach an answer (thats why we are in a Ph.D. prohgram to begin with)
