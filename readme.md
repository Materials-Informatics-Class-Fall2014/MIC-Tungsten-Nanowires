# About this Repository

This repository will serve as a central resource for a project regarding the Electrochemical evolution of tungsten-oxide-hydrate layers on tungsten wire surface. This project is an application of the information we are learning in the ME8883/CSE8803 Materials Informatics course at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

This course uses and applies data science to produce and evaluate process-structure-property linkages for the above mentioned project. This project comes from Clemson University courtesy of [Maryana Nave](http://www.clemson.edu/ces/kornevlab/people.html) and [Dr. Kornev](http://www.clemson.edu/mse/people/bios/Kornev.htm). The original work, "Transport-limited electrochemical formation of long nanosharp probes from tungsten," can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/239248920).

# About this Branch

The ``gh-page`` branch of a Github repository provides a web hosting service for its underlying content. This course's project content will be served through Github because it provides a very close interconnection between codes, data, publication, and colaboration.
